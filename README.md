# Implementing Rate Limiting in .NET Web APIs

This repo is about the implementation of rate limiting in .NET Web APIs, essential for managing traffic and maintaining system integrity.

The code shows how ASP.NET Core's Rate Limiting Middleware helps prevent abuse and ensures service availability and performance. Developers can configure rate limiting policies based on IP, user, or specific endpoints.

It also covers using the K6 tool to test rate limiting by simulating realistic loads and evaluating performance under different conditions, providing a comprehensive approach to managing API traffic effectively.
